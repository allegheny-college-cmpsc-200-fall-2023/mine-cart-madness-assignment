## Learning objectives

* explain how `malloc` and `free` interact with the heap leve of the memory hierarchy
* identify and describe pointer variables and how they benefit `C` language programs
* demonstrate the process of referencing and dereferencing basic pointers
* implement linked-list structures to create and manage complex heap-based memory programming

## Introduction

### `teleporter`

Complete this work in [teleporter/main.c](teleporter/main.c).

Have you ever wanted to move numbers around with your _mind_? New moon-based technology makes that happen. In this training exercise, you'll practice basic principles of `pointer`-based teleportation.

### `passcode`

Complete this work in [passcode/main.c](passcode/main.c).

We need to bury a passcode deep in our devices to retrieve it when it's our time to head to the moonbase. Here, we'll take a look at how we can allocate memory directly to the unorganized, but helpfully obfustcated `Heap`.

### `cart-training`

Complete this work in [cart-training/main.c](cart-training/main.c).

Once you show up to work, as the saying goes, it's work time. To operated moon rock mining carts, you'll need to make short `trains` of them. Here, we'll look at a structure called a `linked list` which gives us the power to couple mining cars to sent into the moon rock mine.

### Changes to files in `.vscode`

Based on your system setup (refer to your `hello-blinky` assignment), you will need switch out the `.vscode` folder in each exercise with the _last working copy_.
