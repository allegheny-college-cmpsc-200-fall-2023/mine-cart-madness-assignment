# Mine Cart Madness: General report

As we approach the end of our basic course in `C`, we examine:

* how `malloc` and `free` interact with the heap level of the memory hierarchy
* pointer variables and how they benefit C language programs
* the process of referencing and dereferencing basic pointers
* linked-list structures to create and manage complex heap-based memory programming

## How much space did our mine carts eventually take up? How can you justify this?

> Hint: account for what takes up memory and _how much_.

`TODO`

### Is that a lot of memory relative to our microcontroller? Why does it matter if we do or don't `free` it?

> Fun fact: our microcontroller only has 264 KB of total memory.

`TODO`

## In your own words, what's a `pointer`? What are _2 different examples_ from your work?

> Note: There are different uses here, not just the 2 `cart`s.

`TODO`

### The `README` explicitly says that there's a high likelihood that you used `char *` pointers. Where and why?

`TODO`

## Describe the process of creating your linked list. What was your ultimate solution and how did you arrive at it using `pointer`s?
